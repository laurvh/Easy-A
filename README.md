# EasyA

This project can figure out which professors in which classes are giving the most As, and which professors are giving the fewest Ds or Fs. The system could help students to an “easy A” or make sure that they “just pass”. The system uses grade data from 2013-2016 at the University of Oregon. The data is provided by the Daily Emerald.
